=============

Automatic Broadcast Plugin for CraftBukkit

The "title" is the custom name that appears before each message.

The "timer" is the time in seconds between the appearance of each message.

You can have as many messages as you would like.

If you would like to use color-codes use the '&' symbol followed by 0-9 and a-f. For more information on 
color-codes visit, http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Formatting_codes.

If you use a color-code ensure that the string is surrounded by single-quotes (' ').

EXAMPLE:

INCORRECT:

1: This &1is &fa test of &6the color-codes

CORRECT:

1: 'This &1is &fa test of &6the color-codes'
